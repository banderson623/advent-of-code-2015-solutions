# Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A nice string is one with **all** of the following properties:

* It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.
* It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (dd), or `aabbccdd` (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
* It does not contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.
